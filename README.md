## Deliverable 1:  Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Linear Regression Summary: 

![non-random-var](https://github.com/NickFoley47/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Pics/non-random-var.PNG)

Vehicle length and ground clearance are unlikely to provide random amounts of variance. The P value of the linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11 which is smaller than the assumed significance level of .05%. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis, and the slope of our linear model is not zero. The R-squared value is 0.7149, which means roughly 71% of the variability of our dependent variable (mpg) is explained using this linear model.

Summary of Each Lot:

Lot 1 and lot 2 meet the design specification. Lot 1 variance is .979 and lot 2 variance is 7.469 which are in the accepted since the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Lot 3 exceeds the allowed amount, and the variance is 170.286. Lots 1 and 2 meet specifications.
